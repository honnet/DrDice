# Dr Dice!

## What ?

This project is the result of a stupid collaboration, during a stupid hackathon in a stupid hackerspace. It's about a knitted dice with some stupid electronics inside, if you throw it, a sound when is played when it stops on a face. Those faces have different pictures related to the famous Dr. Who, and their associated sounds:
* Dalek
* TARDIS
* Sonic Screwdriver
* Random
* Cyberman
* Dr Who

## How?

Technically, here is what we used:
* Accelerometer LSM303DLM (+unused gyro & compass) from http://pololu.com/product/1265
* Mini Audio FX Board (includes an arduino) from http://adafru.it/23411
* Speaker from http://adafru.it/1890
* Charging circuit from http://adafru.it/1905
* later: LEDs ?
